nature's course

for librarys ~
apt install libsdl2-dev

ideas
- make code compilable on various distrobutions (maybe wangblows if not too big of changes)
- camera zoom
- collision
- carnivores / omnivores
- click to add entities
- randomly generate new types of creatures
- gui speed up / down
- DNA which is mixed with mate and passed to child
- pick a c naming/coding standard and stick with it
- show framerate in gui
